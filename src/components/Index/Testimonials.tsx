              review="At Project Partners we have used Danny on two occasions now.  Most recently I engaged with him to support the build of our internal SharePoint site.
              Danny delivered against our requirements, asked questions, researched and self taught where needed.
              Danny was patient, responsive, provided training and created training videos where needed.  He keep us up to date with daily progress reports.
              We are very pleased with the new look of our SharePoint site and have since launched internally to all of our Partners.
              Thank-you Danny for your help and support and we look forward to working together again in the future."

He was very patient as I was unable to keep in regular contact and also not 100% sure of what I needed. The final product is fantastic and has attracted lots of positive feedback. I am delighted with the end result and would recommend Dan highly to anyone needing a website. Thank you very much."
